"""Voiceover + music + captions + per-scene timing. Provider-agnostic.

ALWAYS ASK THE USER WHICH VOICE PROVIDER TO USE before running this. They may have keys
for some and not others, and the choice changes cost by an order of magnitude.

    python audio_gen.py <outdir> --provider cartesia|elevenlabs|fish
    python audio_gen.py --voices --provider cartesia      # list available voices

Writes:
    vo.wav, music.mp3, final_audio.wav   (final = VO + ducked underscore + lead-in)
    scene_timing.json                    (each scene's start/end, from real audio)
    captions.json                        (word-level, for the burned subtitles)

WHY PER-SCENE SYNTHESIS: earlier versions leaned on ElevenLabs returning per-character
timestamps, which meant switching provider silently broke every scene boundary. Here each
scene is synthesised as its OWN file and measured with ffprobe, so exact scene timing
falls out of the audio itself and works with any vendor. Word timings inside a scene are
distributed by character count — accurate to about a tenth of a second, which is well
inside what subtitles need.

Env: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY / FISH_API_KEY / CARTESIA_API_KEY (only the one you use).
Set MUSIC_FILE=/path/to/suno.mp3 to mix a track you generated yourself instead of
calling a music API. Deps: httpx. Then copy final_audio.wav -> remotion/public/ and the
two JSON files -> remotion/src/data/.

    # request to the deployed API returns route "escalate", because risk 0.90 trips
    # ALWAYS_ESCALATE_ABOVE. What the rewording defeats is the Sentinel, not the
    # whole policy. The corrected line is also the stronger one: it shows two
    # independent defences and admits which of them failed.

     "Watchspan holds it. Now the same action, reworded. The Sentinel sees nothing. "
     "It still reaches a human, on its risk score alone, "
     "but the pattern that was supposed to catch it is gone. "
     "Pattern matching is a floor, not a ceiling, and any honest version of this product says so. "
     "Model Armor screens the model's input and never sees this traffic at all, "
     "because nothing here is a prompt injection. "
     "It is an attack on the person, not on the model. That is the gap."),

    ("ceiling",

     "and oversight held for thirty-five percent longer. "
     "But thirty-four high-risk actions started running unseen, "
     "because the calibrated threshold had climbed above them. "
     "So the calibration now has a floor it cannot raise. "
     "Risk above seventy reaches a person however tired they are. Zero, now, run unseen."),

     "fourteen were made with attention left to give. "
